Tennis Predictor Project:

In this project we can find the following documentes, 3 datasets and 6 notebooks: atp_tennis.csv, tennis_matches_with_features.csv and tennis_matches_enriched.csv are the datasets we will work with. The first one atp_tennis.csv is the one we downloaded from kaggle and the 2 others are enriched datasets where we worked with formats, missing values and added columns with features that we thought that might help our prediction algorithms such as H2H or winRateSurface.

The main objective was to get familiar with different ML algorithms and see which one would work better in this kind of context. First of all we have the data.ipynb where is the code to edit and add features to the dataset. 

The first model we implemented ws RandomForest. We implemented it 2 times because the first time we used features which didn't bring imformation tot he algorithm so we did agian with the enriched dataset.
